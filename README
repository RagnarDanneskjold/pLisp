Features currently supported:

1. Basic operators like CAR, CDR, and other language primitives (cf. Paul Graham's 'Roots of Lisp')
2. Other operators and utility functions written in pLisp itself (there is a rudimentary library at present)
3. Error handling in the form of an '(error "...")' operator
4. Garbage collection
5. A somewhat buggy foreign function interface
6. Ability to store and load images (aka serialization)
7. Macros
8. A rudimentary debugger (step, break, resume, abort)
9. A package system

TODO list:

1. More comprehensive error handling; there are a lot of place where sanity checking of parameters is absent, leading to assertion failures or core dumps.
2. Enhancements to the core library
3. Graphical development environment
4. Compiler
5. Continuations and other implementatins of other 'cool' research ideas

pLisp uses tpl (http://tpl.sourceforge.net/) for serialization and libffi (http://sourceware.org/libffi/) for the foreign function interface.
